# AdventOfCode
My Advent of Code solutions. 

## 2024
I'm doing something really dumb this year, and am doing everything in python. But python is not why it's dumb (though I haven't done Python seriously since college). It's dumb because I am programming everything on an android device. This is inspired by my Day 1/2 laziness/desire to not go into my cold upstairs office.
